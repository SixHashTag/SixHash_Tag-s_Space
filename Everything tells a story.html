		<h1><center>ðŸ“– Everything tells a story ðŸ“–</center></h1>
			Art isn't just a few lines drawn,<br>
			it's a way to express feelings from the heart<br>
			It's a way to escape the reality of our world<br>
			A technique with a simple start<br>
			<br>
			A play has many, many scenes to show<br>
			but it can only be brought to life,<br>
			by the actors who act and show emotion<br>
			like they're living another life<br>
			<br>
			A dance has elegance, class and beauty<br>
			But there are many more genres in the world<br>
			And when the dancers set foot on the stage to perform<br>
			It's like they're telling a story of their own<br>
			<br>
			A literary piece can be of any type<br>
			Stories, poems and more<br>
			They speak of people's lives that are filled<br>
			with adventure, excitement and lore<br>
			<br>
			Music has a way to charm into anyone's heart<br>
			through their body, mind and soul<br>
			But listen closely and you may find<br>
			that the meaning hits more to the soul<br>
