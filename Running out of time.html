		<h1><center>üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running out of time ‚è≥</center></h1>
			I wish I could've been a better sister<br>
			I wish I could've been a better guide<br>
			<br>
			Oh but-<br>
			life's to short sweetheart<br>
			I don't know if I'll<br>
			even make it out alive<br>
			<br>
			'Cause I'm-<br>
			lost within the pages of my life<br>
			And I-<br>
			fear the end is right behind<br>
			<br>
			I feel my life flash before my eyes<br>
			Wake up once more to see the light<br>
			Days pass like seconds and I feel like<br>
			that I'm running out of time<br>
			<br>
			I wish I could've been loyal to you<br>
			And maybe a bit obedient too<br>
			<br>
			But hey!<br>
			You got me as your child<br>
			And for that I-<br>
			Sincerly apologize<br>
			<br>
			'Cause I've-<br>
			been making many mistakes my whole life<br>
			And I'm-<br>
			Sorry that I can't be that perfect child<br>
			<br>
			I feel my life flash before my eyes<br>
			Wake up once more to see the light<br>
			Days pass like seconds and I feel like<br>
			that I'm running out of time<br>
			<br>
			Why... should there be an end of time?<br>
			When we could all be living fine<br>
			without tracing the past over and over and<br>
			over again<br>
			<br>
			I... wish there's a way that I can find<br>
			a safer place where I could hide<br>
			from the gruesome death by time<br>
			that consumes all of our lives<br>
			<br>
			'Cause I've feared for the day of my life<br>
			When the clock stops tracking the time<br>
			And I have to utter out my final goodbyes<br>
			<br>
			I fee my life flash before my eyes<br>
			Wake up once more to see the light<br>
			Days pass like seconds and I feel like<br>
			that I'm running out of time<br>
