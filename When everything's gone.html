		<h1><center>When everything's gone...</center></h1>
			When a meteorite is about to hit Earth<br>
			And there'd only be minutes left<br>
			I'd be the first one to stay in the danger zone<br>
			and stand my ground 'till it hits<br>
			<br>
			When the environment is polluted to the point<br>
			That no one could even survive<br>
			I'd be the only one outside with a smile on my face<br>
			While others run for their lives<br>
			<br>
			When a dooms-day bomb is going to blow up in minutes<br>
			And everyone runs and hides<br>
			I'd be in my home sipping my tea<br>
			Thinking about good old times<br>
			<br>
			And when the time has come for the universe's end<br>
			To everyone else, it's like they've been stabbed by a knife<br>
			And when everything's gone, that is the day<br>
			I'd be the happiest I've been in my life<br>
