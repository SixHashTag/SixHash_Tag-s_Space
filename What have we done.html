		<h1><center>ðŸ’” What have we done...ðŸ’”</center></h1>
			What have we done,<br>
			to this planet of ours?<br>
			Filled with pollution in the air,<br>
			Because of the gas from our cars<br>
			<br>
			The beautiful world<br>
			we all know and love<br>
			became an unbearable waste land<br>
			with junk and grub<br>
			<br>
			What have we done,<br>
			to the forests and jungles?<br>
			Once green and beautiful<br>
			now a large mass filled with bundles,<br>
			<br>
			Bundles of factories<br>
			that work day and night<br>
			Releasing smog<br>
			giving animals a fright<br>
			<br>
			What have we done,<br>
			to the oceans, so blue?<br>
			Now filled with garbage<br>
			with a greenish hue<br>
			<br>
			Animalâ€™s lives,<br>
			are all in danger.<br>
			Suffocating in our junk<br>
			and not even a stranger<br>
			<br>
			Helps for the necessities<br>
			of the world and preventing,<br>
			these crucial actions.<br>
			And now our world is decayingâ€¦<br>
