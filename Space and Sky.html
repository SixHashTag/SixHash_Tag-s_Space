		<h1><center>ðŸŒŒâ˜„ Space and Sky ðŸŒŒâ˜„</center></h1>
			Beauty lies within the things we see<br>
			Like flowers, butterflies and bumble bees<br>
			But there's a place so wondrous and yet to see<br>
			A place so mysterious as any place can be<br>
			<br>
			As we look upon the sky, so blue and dashing<br>
			But as soon as night falls, it feels so mesmerizing<br>
			With twinkling stars filled in the night sky<br>
			Shimmering and shining like diamonds up high<br>
			<br>
			The moon so bright like a sparkly gem<br>
			Giving us light in the dark within<br>
			As shooting stars pass by like rockets<br>
			Making a wish upon more than a dozen<br>
			<br>
			Exploring new planets, galaxies and more<br>
			Making new discoveries in our space ships we soar<br>
			Through space and time with no worries at all<br>
			We'll fly through the sky like we're kings of it all<br>
