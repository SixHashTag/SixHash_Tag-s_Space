		<h1><center>❔ Destined to fall, but can WE change? <a href="https://sixhashtag.github.io/Box-From-The-Shadows/">❔</a></center></h1>
			Economic crisis getting more worse<br>
			Stolk prices rising sky high<br>
			Never ending problems in a bloody nation<br>
			A nation that's built to die<br>
			<br>
			From peace to war and war to peace<br>
			This cycle just never ends<br>
			Unless someone comes and breaks the cycle<br>
			and stand their ground till the end<br>
			<br>
			Even though they say we got our freedom<br>
			in 1948<br>
			We're still under the rule of greater people<br>
			Because it is our fate<br>
			<br>
			And though they say that fate can change<br>
			I doubt that this one can<br>
			Because the people of this country will never change<br>
			It's a curse upon our land<br>
			<br>
			No matter if you're here to help<br>
			And even if you're not<br>
			The people will cry "What a freak!"<br>
			And leave you there to rot<br>
			<br>
			The government won't fix this economic crisis<br>
			They're just waiting for people to donate<br>
			When they can help with this problem, they just stand there<br>
			Ignoring our complaints<br>
			<br>
			This nations' pride is hanging by a rope<br>
			And just one single wrong step<br>
			We'll slip and fall to the abyss of the forgotten<br>
			And we'll be stuck there with nothing but regret<br>
			<br>
			This country had always been in danger<br>
			It's something that can't be changed<br>
			It's the fate of our people, we're destined to fall<br>
			But can WE change?<br>
			<br>
			"Yes we can!" I think you might say<br>
			And I agree with you too<br>
			Because this country desperately needs it<br>
			And what harm does a little change do?<br>
			<br>
			But trust me, millions have tried to change them<br>
			But nothing has ever worked<br>
			Because they always believe that those people were wrong<br>
			And say that "Tradition comes first"<br>
			<br>
			And most of the time they don't care what other people say<br>
			Their opinions don't matter to them<br>
			If their leaders and elders say it's wrong without a second thought<br>
			They would ignore the opinions you have<br>
			<br>
			And worst of all is that they can manipulate<br>
			the country's young youth<br>
			Telling them to only follow their traditions<br>
			Even if it's not the truth<br>
			<br>
			And I'm sorry if what I'm saying bothers you<br>
			I just wanted to tell my opinion too<br>
			But even if what I have said is mean<br>
			Isn't it kind of true?<br>
			<br>
			And I know you're thinking, even though I've said all of this,<br>
			Aren't I a Sri Lankan too?<br>
			But I never once said that I liked this country<br>
			Nor the people that live there too<br>
			<br>
			Unless the people of this country decide to change<br>
			all their ways or at least try<br>
			My hatred for this country, forever will live<br>
			Until the day I die<br>
			<br>
			But if you ever hear them beg and cry for help<br>
			Please don't look back<br>
			This country deserves the torture, it was never meant to be<br>
			It was never meant to last<br>
