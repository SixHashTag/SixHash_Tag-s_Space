		<h1><center>ðŸŒŠ The song of a flowing river ðŸŒŠ</center></h1>
			The song of a flowing river<br>
			reminds me of the peace we used to have<br>
			No wars or fights for freedom<br>
			Just playing around makes us glad<br>
			<br>
			The chirp of a thousand birds<br>
			Makes me remember the times we had<br>
			Where we hadn't got a care in the world<br>
			Just children's songs and laughs<br>
			<br>
			The sound of the wind bristling through trees<br>
			Makes me realize that, way back then<br>
			How we used to dream of a place of beauty<br>
			Where we're free to do whatever we can<br>
			<br>
			The smell of a field of roses<br>
			used to give me hope<br>
			That we can make this world a better place<br>
			When we're just hanging by a rope<br>
			<br>
			Now the river has dried up<br>
			And peace has become war<br>
			And all those childhood songs and memories<br>
			Are soon to be no more<br>
			<br>
			And the forests have been burnt out<br>
			The fields are now gone<br>
			And the children of this bloody nation<br>
			with no hope, stand alone<br>
