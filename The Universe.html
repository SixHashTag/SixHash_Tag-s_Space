		<h1><center>✨ The Universe ✨</center></h1>
			A vast open space,<br>
			expanding every minute.<br>
			A place that holds time,<br>
			and more planets we could visit.<br>
			<br>
			A place with many galaxies,<br>
			and stars filled in the night sky.<br>
			Oh how I wish I could go out there,<br>
			and fly so high.<br>
			<br>
			The universe is so beautiful,<br>
			so dark and mysterious.<br>
			As the stars shimmer and glow in the night,<br>
			like a garden filled with roses.<br>
			<br>
			We are lucky as can be,<br>
			to have a place like this.<br>
			Our universe is our home,<br>
			and we thank the Gods for this gift.<br>
