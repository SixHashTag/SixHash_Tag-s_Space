		<h1><center>ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Origin of a Villain ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</center></h1>
			We've known about villains since we were little<br>
			From fairytales and old legends long ago<br>
			But the past that they've lived and the hardships they've faced<br>
			Are somethings that we all don't know<br>
			<br>
			We've heard of the many crimes they've committed<br>
			And all their legends and myths<br>
			But does anyone know why they became evil<br>
			in the first place to begin with<br>
			<br>
			The Joker was never a bad person to begin with<br>
			He was just misunderstood<br>
			The society made him what he is today<br>
			When we all knew he could be good<br>
			<br>
			And even though Thanos destroyed half of the population<br>
			He did it for a reason<br>
			But if he hadn't, they would have been in danger<br>
			Fore an unknown force of evil could've happened<br>
			<br>
			And just like in the stories there are villains in real life<br>
			that commit crimes and have mischievous ways<br>
			Who've been let down and betrayed by society itself<br>
			with no one to correct their bad ways<br>
