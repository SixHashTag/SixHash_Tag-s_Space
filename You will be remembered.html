		<h1><center>😔🎗 You will be remembered 😔🎗</center></h1>
			For most, life is a luxury<br>
			A time you live it to the fullest<br>
			Though time itself can run out<br>
			And it's quicker to the cruellest<br>
			<br>
			But it can be filled with cruelty<br>
			Even for the nicest<br>
			And there might never be a way to end it<br>
			Because Karma is what the price is<br>
			<br>
			But I'm happy for the time we had to spend<br>
			You had a great and successful life<br>
			And when I look back at all those memories<br>
			I know that I'd miss you all my life<br>
			<br>
			And even though you might be gone<br>
			We'd always remember you<br>
			And I know you'd always be here with us<br>
			This is my tribute to you<br>
