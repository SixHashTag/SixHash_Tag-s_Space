    <h1><b><center>🎉 Welcome! 🎉</center></b></h1>
	
	 <p>What's up guys? It's Hash here! And I made my very own website!! 
	 Yup. And I used a specific app called Notepad++ for it. If you 
	 think you want to start coding and if you're new to it, I highly 
	 recommend it. It is really beginner friendly, and has all sorts of
	 different languages like html, python, Java Script etc. And you can 
	 even add plugins like Python and more! It really is a great app and 
	 has showed me how easy coding can be. I have the link right below the 
	 web page so you can all check it out. And don't forget to check out 
	 my channel and all of my other social medias I'm available in. If 
	 any of y'all wanna contact me, just message me in twitter or send an 
	 e-mail to my gmail account. Also I have used a font that isn't available
	 unless you download it. So go download the Roboto Mono font family
	 from google fonts and install it.</p>
	
	 <p>With that folks, I'll end it right here. Till next time,<br>
	 Peace! ✌🏽</p>
