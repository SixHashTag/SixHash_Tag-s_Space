		<h1><center>ðŸŽ— I remember ðŸŽ—</center></h1>
			I remember the days we'd go outside<br>
			And stop by the animal farm<br>
			We'd pet every animal run around the place<br>
			And talk to the people in the barn<br>
			<br>
			I remember the times I went to your place<br>
			It gave me an aura like home<br>
			A place of peace and harmony<br>
			And where we used to roam<br>
			<br>
			I remember when I used to sit next to your bed<br>
			As you hold my hand in yours<br>
			Saying that it's all going to be just fine<br>
			When you know it won't<br>
			<br>
			And now I am in front of your grave<br>
			On my knees, sobbing, as I sigh<br>
			That, the person who gave me all those memories,<br>
			Had to say goodbye<br>
