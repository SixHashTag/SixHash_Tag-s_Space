		<h1><center>üíù Be Thankful üíù</center></h1>
			People ain‚Äôt the same,<br>
			They‚Äôre special their one way<br>
			We know where we belong<br>
			But we do some things wrong<br>
			<br>
			We might take what we need<br>
			but never give it back<br>
			Our world is in danger<br>
			And people have lost track<br>
			<br>
			Taking things is okay<br>
			but we all must be kind<br>
			So what I'm trying to say<br>
			is open up your mind<br>
			<br>
			And be thankful<br>
			for what we have<br>
			Be greatful<br>
			for what we get<br>
			<br>
			And appreciat<br>
			planet Earth<br>
			and our mothers<br>
			for giving us birth<br>
			<br>
			These days are rough<br>
			but together we can't be stopped<br>
			<br>
			And be thankful<br>
			for what we have<br>
			Be greatful<br>
			for what we get<br>
			<br>
			And appreciat<br>
			planet Earth<br>
			and our mothers<br>
			for giving us birth<br>
			<br>
			Poluting the Earth isn't good<br>
			Destroying animals isn't good<br>
			But together we'll do this right<br>
			And reach the clouds up high<br>
			<br>
			And be thankful<br>
			for what we have<br>
			Be greatful<br>
			for what we get<br>
			<br>
			And appreciat<br>
			planet Earth<br>
			and our mothers<br>
			for giving us birth<br>
			<br>
			(and our mothers<br>
			for giving us birth)<br>
