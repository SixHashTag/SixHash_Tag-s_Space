		<h1><center>🙏📖 Religion and Humanity 📖🙏</center></h1>
			Every culture has its own religion<br>
			Something that tells the myths<br>
			And legends of gods, mighty warriors and leaders<br>
			And how their power, to us, was a gift<br>
			<br>
			And what religion is complete<br>
			Without its own set of traditions<br>
			Either a sacrificial ceremony to the gods<br>
			Or a little praying session<br>
			<br>
			These religions they say<br>
			Last till the end of time<br>
			Although they haven't been here<br>
			Since the beginning of time<br>
			<br>
