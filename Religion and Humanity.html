		<h1><center>üõê Religion and Humanity üõê</center></h1>
			Every culture has its own religion<br>
			Something that tells the myths<br>
			and legends of gods, mighty warriors and leaders<br>
			and how their power, to us, is a gift<br>
			<br>
			And what religion is complete<br>
			without its own set of traditions<br>
			Either a sacrificial ceremony to the gods<br>
			or a little praying session<br>
			<br>
			These religions they say<br>
			last till the end of time<br>
			Although they haven't been here<br>
			since the beginning of time<br>
			<br>
			But has anyone known why<br>
			they've been created in the first place<br>
			Why such thing was ever created<br>
			Has your suspicion never been raised?<br>
			<br>
			Sure, they say that it has been created by god<br>
			So that our people would learn<br>
			to be nice and respectful to other people<br>
			But isn't it so that they could earn?<br>
			<br>
			And by earn I don't only mean money<br>
			but to earn popularity too<br>
			And to maybe get a great place in heaven<br>
			Now isn't that kind of true?<br>
			<br>
			Yes, religion was made for a good purpose<br>
			Not that I don't know of<br>
			But many people take advantage of it<br>
			And use it for a bad purpose<br>
			<br>
			Religion was made so people would be better<br>
			And that they would put humanity first<br>
			but because of it many people have been ruined<br>
			And it made matters worse<br>
			<br>
			People have learned to judge a book by its cover<br>
			And never give others a chance<br>
			If someone looked weird or different to them<br>
			They won't even give them a glance<br>
			<br>
			And because of this started racism<br>
			Where people were judged of their race<br>
			or the color of their skin would make them judge<br>
			and believe that they're a disgrace<br>
			<br>
			People have lost their human ways<br>
			And are now kind to others because<br>
			they expect some fame for their good deed<br>
			Or earn some cash for their "ways of good"<br>
			<br>
			They say what you hear and see is not always true<br>
			So don't be a fool<br>
			And if you were ever given a chance to pick between religion and humanity<br>
			Which one will you choose?<br>
