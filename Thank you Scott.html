		<h1><center>ðŸŽ— Thank you Scott...ðŸŽ—</center></h1>
			[Verse 1]<br>
			In the modern day<br>
			It's been tough you see<br>
			But anyone can change that <br>
			believe me<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 2]<br>
			Playing games with friends<br>
			Or having a fun career<br>
			For me it has been<br>
			A very free year<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 3]<br>
			If it wasn't for you<br>
			We wouldn't have this career<br>
			And life would have been boring<br>
			If you weren't here<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 4]<br>
			You're a great person<br>
			The greatest from the rest<br>
			We all love your game<br>
			FNaF is the best<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 5]<br>
			You've inspired others<br>
			YouTubers too<br>
			And we couldn't have done it<br>
			Without you<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 6]<br>
			Although, you have plans<br>
			And other things to do<br>
			like taking care of your family<br>
			and spending time with them too<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 7]<br>
			Your family is important<br>
			They mean the world to you<br>
			And we respect that<br>
			for our family is important to us too<br>
			<br>
			[Verse 8]<br>
			Thank you for everything<br>
			But your kids future must bloom<br>
			Good bye Scott Cawthon<br>
			I hope we see you again soon<br>
