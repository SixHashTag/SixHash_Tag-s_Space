		<h1><center>ðŸŒ¼ Dandelions (My Cover) ðŸŒ¼</center></h1>
			Maybe it's the way you say my name<br>
			Maybe it's the way you play your game<br>
			<br>
			But it's so bad<br>
			Wish I've never met anybody like you<br>
			But it's so bad<br>
			Wish I've never dreamt of somebody like you<br>
			<br>
			And I've heard that true love sometimes won't last for a life time<br>
			And I'm pretty sure that you aren't that love of mine<br>
			<br>
			'Cause I'm sick and tired of dandelions<br>
			Wishing on everyone's a waste of time... time...<br>
			And I see the hatred in your eyes<br>
			I feel ok when I know you're gone... gone...<br>
			<br>
			Wishing on dandelions all of the time<br>
			Praying to god that maybe I'll be fine<br>
			Wishing on dandelions all of the time<br>
			All of the time...<br>
			<br>
			I think that you aren't the one for me<br>
			'Cause it gets so hard to breathe<br>
			<br>
			Now that you're gone<br>
			Finally, I can be in peace<br>
			Yeah it's so good<br>
			I've never felt so alive and free<br>
			<br>
			And I've heard that true love sometimes won't last for a life time<br>
			And I'm pretty sure that you aren't that love of mine<br>
			<br>
			'Cause I'm sick and tired of dandelions<br>
			Wishing on everyone's a waste of time... time...<br>
			And I see the hatred in your eyes<br>
			I feel ok when I know you're gone... gone...<br>
			<br>
			Wishing on dandelions all of the time<br>
			Praying to god that maybe I'll be fine<br>
			Wishing on dandelions all of the time<br>
			All of the time...<br>
			<br>
			Dandelion into the wind you go<br>
			Won't you let my darling know<br>
			Dandelion into the wind you go<br>
			Won't you let my darling know<br>
			That...<br>
			<br>
			I'm sick and tired of dandelions<br>
			Wishing on everyone's a waste of time... time...<br>
			And I see the hatred in your eyes<br>
			I feel ok now that you are gone... gone...<br>
			<br>
			Wishing on dandelions all of the time<br>
			Praying to god that maybe I'll be fine<br>
			Now that you're gone, finally<br>
			I'm free...<br>
