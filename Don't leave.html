		<h1><center>ðŸ˜¢ Don't leave ðŸ˜¢</center></h1>
			High school teen<br>
			wearing large tops and baggy jeans<br>
			Oh so quiet but still social<br>
			if you meet her down the street<br>
			<br>
			She's nice but can be mean<br>
			But she'll try her best to be gentle, trust me<br>
			She's respectful but she doubts<br>
			if she is loyal though it seems<br>
			<br>
			But she's got so many secrets<br>
			Her whole family's crumbling because...<br>
			<br>
			'Cause their tired of her bullshit<br>
			They can't take it anymore<br>
			Now she's scared that if one day<br>
			they'll walk out that door<br>
			<br>
			And never come back...<br>
			<br>
			But please! Don't you go<br>
			I promise that I can do more<br>
			I'll sail across the seven seas<br>
			If I have to find you so<br>
			<br>
			Please! Don't you leave<br>
			Without you I can never be<br>
			The one that's here today so<br>
			Could you listen to me, will you? Please,<br>
			<br>
			Please don't leave...<br>
			<br>
			I never wanted anything bad to happen in our lives<br>
			But I guess you could say it's the price I have to pay for all my sins<br>
			And I've always been battling the fear that you might leave<br>
			But somehow that anxiety always finds a way to win<br>
			<br>
			Yeah I'm that high school teen<br>
			filled with depression and anxiety<br>
			The one that always struggles<br>
			to be stable mentally<br>
			<br>
			I'm nice but mostly mean<br>
			But I always do my best, oh trust me<br>
			I always try to reach<br>
			But you're too high though it seems<br>
			<br>
			But I've got so many secrets<br>
			And my sanity's crumbling because...<br>
			<br>
			'Cause I'm tired of this bullshit, I can't take it anymore<br>
			No matter what I try I'd always fail and end up back in the start<br>
			Now I'm scared that if one day you'll walk out that door<br>
			And never come back...<br>
			<br>
			But please don't you go!<br>
			You don't know that I'll miss you so<br>
			You're my whole world and without you,<br>
			I'd have nowhere else to go<br>
			<br>
			Please don't you leave!<br>
			If you go I'd be so lonely<br>
			This fragile heart of mine can't stand you gone, so please,<br>
			Please don't leave...<br>
