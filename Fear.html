		<h1><center>ðŸ”¥ Fear ðŸ”¥</center></h1>
			Ended up in a dark place<br>
			I didn't know where I had to go<br>
			But now I see it all<br>
			<br>
			I was confused but now I know<br>
			That I was meant to be here so<br>
			I'll go with the flow<br>
			<br>
			My soul is covered up with the darkness it holds<br>
			It was effected by your cruel games<br>
			As I stare into the pitch black void so cold<br>
			I can here evil calling my name<br>
			<br>
			I create, I destroy<br>
			I'm no longer your toy<br>
			I'll make it all go up in fire<br>
			I will scare, I'll control<br>
			I will be feared by all<br>
			I'm the villain and I'll make them see<br>
			that I'm fear himself<br>
			<br>
			The day you left me cold<br>
			I left my heart behind<br>
			Babe now I'm the monster you've feared all along<br>
			<br>
			Oh you can hate me so much<br>
			'Cause it's just what I want<br>
			And tonight I'm taking you to hell<br>
			<br>
			The table have turned and now I'm what they fear<br>
			Dread me 'cause I'll haunt you till death<br>
			Oh darling can't you see this is my villain arc<br>
			And you'll perish by my own hands<br>
			<br>
			My soul is covered up with the darkness it holds<br>
			It was effected by your cruel games<br>
			But now that I have the power you'll never control<br>
			You will burn in hell's eternal flames<br>
			<br>
			I create, I destroy<br>
			I'm no longer your toy<br>
			I'll make it all go up in fire<br>
			They'll drown till they can't breathe<br>
			And they'll never be free<br>
			Oh you're trapped darling and now you see<br>
			that I'm fear himself<br>
